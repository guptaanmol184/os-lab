Now you need to have a link for a m3u playlist. Now that you have it installed. Click on it, accept the terms of service.

ok first thing it wants is add playlist. Then it wants you to give it a name. Then it wants the url

of your playlist. Ok, once you have that typed in correctly. Go down and hit save. now exit the playlist player back to your homescreen.

you have to do this so the playlist player can save it to memory. Now reenter the playlist player and

find your list. Highlite it and press OK. Now it should say Loading on the screen. Once loaded you should see some sort or channel list or file folders of some sorts. Depending of how complex your list is. Select a channel or folder and watch till your hearts content. If 

you get bumped out of the channel

your watching thats because the format of the channel doesn't work real well with the player. Just have to live with it or 

find another list.

better at it the more you do it. So don't give up after your first try.
