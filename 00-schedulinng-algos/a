-=--=--=- Section #1: Mandiant and Adi Peretz Leaks Part #1 -=--=--=-

Operation #LeakTheAnalyst:
 
In Blackhats we trust,
 
Nobody understands the amount of dedication it takes to break into a highly secured network, to bypass every state of the art security measure installed to make a targeted network unbreakable, to code and hack not for the money but for the pleasure of being somewhere no one can be in, to be addicted to pain.
 
From time to time there is a know-it-all security professional tries to read your sick mind and blow your breach plan up to hell.
 
For a long time we - the 31337 hackers - tried to avoid these fancy ass "Analysts" whom trying to trace our attack footprints back to us and prove they are better than us. In the #LeakTheAnalyst operation we say fuck the consequence let’s track them on Facebook, Linked-in, Tweeter, etc. let’s go after everything they’ve got, let’s go after their countries, let’s trash their reputation in the field. If during your stealth operation you pwned an analyst, target him and leak his personal and professional data, as a side job of course ;).
 
In the operation #LeakTheAnalyst our motto is:
If they are going to send us back to hell, Let’s unleash hell upon them; Before it’s too late...
 
Join us @ Op. #LeakTheAnalyst.
